            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>1. Introduction This Privacy Policy governs the use of the Fuel Tracker mobile application ("the App"). The App is a simple tool designed to help users track vehicle refueling and mileage.

2. Information Collection and Use

Personal Data: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). No account creation is required to use the App.

User Input Data: The data you enter (odometer readings, fuel amounts, and dates) is stored locally on your device using an internal SQLite database. We do not have access to this data.

Sensitive Permissions: The App does not require access to your contacts, camera, microphone, or precise GPS location.

3. Third-Party Services The App does not use third-party analytics, advertising networks, or cloud storage providers. Your data remains entirely under your control.

4. Data Security Since your data is stored locally on your device, its security depends on the security of your mobile device itself. We recommend using standard device security features (like PIN or Biometrics) to protect your information.

5. Data Retention and Deletion You are in full control of your data. To delete all records, you can clear the App's data in your Android settings or uninstall the App. This will permanently remove all logs from your device.

6. Children’s Privacy The App does not collect any information from children, as no data is transmitted to us or any third party.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
